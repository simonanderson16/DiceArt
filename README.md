# DiceArt

The dice_art.py file is the file to be run.

It will ask you for a filepath to turn into dice art.
  Example: What is the file path for the image you would like to use? C:/Users/user/Desktop/directoryName/image.jpg

It will then ask you what dimensions you would like your dice art to be.
  Example: How many dice wide would you like your image to be? 200
           How many dice tall would you like your image to be? 200
  Note: These dimensions should be somewhat proportional to the dimensions of your original image. It will give you a warning message if they are not.
  
Once valid dimensions are entered, or you have noted that you would like to proceed despite the warning, a dice art version of your image will be generated.
